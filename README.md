# dirlist
dirlist is a simple bash script with timestamp for logging directory contents.

Uses `ls` to list all contents in a directory, then writes/appends the output to file: `dir_list.txt`.

Appends date and time after each directory listing. E.g. "... END OF ENTRY FOR 20/03/2016 AS OF 11:55:20 PM"
